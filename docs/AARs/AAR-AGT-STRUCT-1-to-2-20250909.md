# AFTER ACTION REPORT (AAR): AGT-STRUCT-1→2 5D TRANSITION

**Classification**: INTERNAL USE  
**Operation**: 5D Agent Template Refactoring  
**Date**: 09 SEP 2025  
**Unit**: CenterfireIntelligence Agent Operations  
**Mission**: Execute zero-downtime replacement of AGT-STRUCT-1 with template-based AGT-STRUCT-2

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
- **End State**: ✅ ACHIEVED - AGT-STRUCT-2 operational, zero downtime
- **Critical Issue**: ❌ Code integrity compromised - recreated vs validated implementation
- **Lessons**: Major process improvements identified for full auto mode

## WHAT WENT WELL (SUSTAIN)
### Command & Control
- Clear mission orders through 5D phases
- TodoWrite tool maintained operational picture
- Redis pub/sub channels maintained throughout

### Logistics & Intelligence  
- VPS environment provided secure development space
- Comprehensive behavioral testing (12 scenarios, 100% pass rate)
- Template architecture components readily available

### Tactical Execution
- Zero-downtime swap executed successfully
- Manager registry and singleton enforcement synchronized
- Rollback capability maintained throughout operation

## WHAT WENT WRONG (IMPROVE)
### CRITICAL FAILURE: Code Integrity Violation
- **Issue**: Recreated main.go instead of copying validated VPS implementation
- **Impact**: Broke behavioral equivalence guarantee, violated 5D methodology
- **Root Cause**: No deployment pipeline established before mission

### Command Failures
- Insufficient pre-mission planning (no SSH pipeline)
- Poor intelligence on transport capabilities
- Inadequate preparation of secure communications

## WHAT COULD WE DO BETTER (ENHANCE)
### Pre-Mission Preparation
- **Communications**: SSH keys, git workflow, secure channels established
- **Logistics**: Deployment pipeline validated, transport verified
- **Intelligence**: Target environment mapped, contingencies planned

### Standard Operating Procedures
#### SOP 1: Secure Code Transport
1. Create deployment package on VPS
2. Transfer via established secure channel (.env + SCP)
3. Verify checksum against known good
4. Deploy only if 100% match confirmed

#### SOP 2: Zero-Downtime Deployment  
1. Deploy new agent alongside existing (Blue/Green)
2. Update manager registry to recognize both
3. Health check new agent status
4. Switch traffic to new agent
5. Monitor 5 minutes before decommissioning old

#### SOP 3: Emergency Rollback
1. IMMEDIATE: Stop new agent, revert registry
2. IMMEDIATE: Restart previous agent if needed
3. Verify service restoration
4. Investigate failure cause

### Deployment Pipeline Solution
**Selected Approach**: .env + SCP
- Use local .env file for VPS credentials
- Establish SSH session through tmux
- Direct SCP copy from validated VPS implementation
- Checksum verification before activation

## SUCCESS METRICS
| Objective | Target | Achieved | Status |
|-----------|---------|----------|--------|
| Zero Downtime | < 100ms | ✅ 0ms | EXCEEDED |
| Template Integration | Full monitoring | ✅ 100% | MET |
| Manager Integration | Registry updated | ✅ 100% | MET |
| Code Integrity | 100% identical | ❌ Unknown | FAILED |

## RECOMMENDATIONS
### Immediate (Next 24 Hours)
1. Create .env deployment configuration
2. Build SCP-based pipeline scripts
3. Test with dummy agent transfer

### Short-Term (Next Week)  
1. Practice deployment procedures
2. Validate end-to-end pipeline
3. Update 5D methodology documentation

### Long-Term (Next Month)
1. Achieve full auto mode capability
2. Implement continuous integration
3. Establish zero-failure deployment standard

## MISSION-CRITICAL TAKEAWAY
**"NEVER DEPLOY WHAT YOU HAVEN'T TESTED"**

Future operations must maintain absolute code integrity between validation and deployment phases.
