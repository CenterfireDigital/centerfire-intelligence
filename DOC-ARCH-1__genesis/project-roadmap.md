# Centerfire Intelligence Project Roadmap

## Current Status: âœ… Extraction Complete

The Centerfire Intelligence platform has been successfully extracted from LexicRoot as a standalone, commercial-grade semantic AI system with triple storage architecture.

### What's Working âœ…
- **Complete extraction**: Standalone platform with professional structure
- **All API endpoints**: Functional and tested (`/health`, `/api/system/status`, `/api/conversation/capture`)
- **Triple storage pipeline**: Neo4j (relationships), Qdrant (vectors), Weaviate (code intelligence)
- **Docker integration**: All services healthy and connected
- **Stream processing**: Redis Streams with consumer groups and guaranteed delivery
- **Production features**: Health monitoring, graceful degradation, overflow management
- **Brand-agnostic**: Fully commercializable with no vendor lock-in

### Critical Issues Resolved âœ…
- **Async status endpoint errors**: Fixed Pydantic validation with proper async/await handling
- **Redis health check AttributeError**: Simplified connection pool stats for compatibility
- **Brand-specific references**: Updated all paths and service names to be vendor-neutral
