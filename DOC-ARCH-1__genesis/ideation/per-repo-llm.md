# Per-Repository LLMs: Project Specialist Models (PSMs)

## Vision
Every significant codebase has its own specialized LLM that deeply understands its architecture, patterns, and business logic - a "Project Specialist Model" that serves as the omniscient expert for that specific system.

## Architecture Overview

```
Repository Code + SemDocs → Training Pipeline → Project Specialist Model
                                                          ↓
                                              Development Assistant
                                              Code Review Expert  
                                              Impact Analyzer
                                              Documentation Generator
```

## Core Concepts

### 1. Project Specialist Model (PSM)
A fine-tuned or continually-trained LLM that:
- **Knows every line of code** in the repository
- **Understands all relationships** between components
- **Remembers all design decisions** and their rationale
- **Tracks all Change Intents** and their implementations
- **Maintains complete context** across the entire codebase

### 2. Training Pipeline

```yaml
training_pipeline:
  data_sources:
    code:
      - source_files: "all production code"
      - test_files: "all test code"
      - configuration: "all config files"
    
    semantic:
      - semblocks: "inline documentation"
      - contracts: "behavioral specifications"
      - change_intents: "development history"
    
    operational:
      - git_history: "evolution of code"
      - pull_requests: "review discussions"
      - issues: "bug reports and features"
      - monitoring_data: "production behavior"
  
  processing:
    - ast_parsing: "understand code structure"
    - dependency_analysis: "map relationships"
    - semantic_extraction: "parse SemBlocks"
    - pattern_learning: "identify conventions"
  
  training_modes:
    initial:
      method: "fine-tuning from base model"
      duration: "hours to days"
      frequency: "once at project start"
    
    continuous:
      method: "incremental learning"
      duration: "minutes"
      frequency: "after each commit"
    
    reinforcement:
      method: "learn from feedback"
      source: "code reviews, test results"
      frequency: "continuous"
```

```

### 2. Training Architecture

```python
# PSM Training Pipeline Example
class PSMTrainer:
    def __init__(self, repo_path: str, base_model: str):
        self.repo_path = repo_path
        self.base_model = base_model
        self.knowledge_graph = Neo4j()
        self.vector_store = Qdrant()
        self.code_index = Weaviate()
    
    def extract_training_data(self):
        """Extract all knowledge from repository"""
        return {
            'code': self.parse_source_code(),
            'semblocks': self.extract_semantic_blocks(),
            'contracts': self.parse_contracts(),
            'history': self.analyze_git_history(),
            'documentation': self.process_docs(),
            'tests': self.analyze_test_coverage()
        }
    
    def prepare_training_corpus(self, data):
        """Convert to training format"""
        corpus = []
        
        # Code understanding tasks
        corpus.extend(self.generate_code_qa_pairs(data['code']))
        
        # Contract validation tasks
        corpus.extend(self.generate_contract_validations(data['contracts']))
        
        # Impact analysis tasks
        corpus.extend(self.generate_impact_scenarios(data['history']))
        
        return corpus
    
    def train_model(self, corpus):
        """Fine-tune or train the PSM"""
        # Actual training implementation
        pass
```

### 3. Continuous Learning

```yaml
continuous_learning:
  triggers:
    - event: "commit"
      action: "incremental training"
      scope: "changed files + dependencies"
    
    - event: "pull_request_merged"
      action: "update knowledge"
      scope: "new patterns and decisions"
    
    - event: "production_incident"
      action: "reinforcement learning"
      scope: "failure patterns"
    
    - event: "code_review"
      action: "feedback integration"
      scope: "quality improvements"
  
  update_strategy:
    immediate:
      - "critical bug fixes"
      - "security patches"
      - "breaking changes"
    
    batched:
      - "minor changes"
      - "documentation updates"
      - "test additions"
    
    scheduled:
      - "full retraining: monthly"
      - "optimization: weekly"
      - "cleanup: daily"
```

## Use Cases

### 1. Intelligent Code Completion
PSM provides context-aware suggestions:

```python
# Developer types:
def process_payment(

# PSM suggests based on project patterns:
def process_payment(
    user_id: str,
    amount: Decimal,
    payment_method: PaymentMethod,
    idempotency_key: Optional[str] = None
) -> PaymentResult:
    """
    PSM knows:
    - This project always uses idempotency keys
    - PaymentMethod is an enum defined in types.py
    - PaymentResult includes transaction_id and status
    """
```

### 2. Impact Analysis
PSM predicts effects of changes:

```yaml
change: "Modify User.calculate_score() algorithm"

psm_analysis:
  direct_impacts:
    - "RecommendationEngine uses scores for ranking"
    - "UserDashboard displays score prominently"
    - "EmailCampaign segments based on score"
  
  indirect_impacts:
    - "Cache invalidation needed for user_scores"
    - "Analytics dashboard KPIs will shift"
    - "A/B test results may be affected"
  
  risk_assessment:
    - "High traffic endpoint (10k requests/min)"
    - "Score changes trigger notifications"
    - "Downstream ML model uses scores as features"
  
  recommendations:
    - "Add feature flag for gradual rollout"
    - "Implement backward compatibility mode"
    - "Alert data science team about change"
```

### 3. Code Review Assistant
PSM reviews code against project standards:

```python
# Submitted PR code:
def get_user(user_id):
    return db.query(f"SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = {user_id}")

# PSM Review:
"""
Issues detected:
1. SQL Injection vulnerability - use parameterized queries
2. Missing type hints (project standard requires them)
3. No error handling (project pattern is to use Result type)
4. Violates contract: user.yaml specifies caching required

Suggested fix:
"""
def get_user(user_id: str) -> Result[User, UserError]:
    cache_key = f"user:{user_id}"
    if cached := cache.get(cache_key):
        return Ok(cached)
    
    try:
        user = db.query(
            "SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = ?",
            [user_id]
        )
        cache.set(cache_key, user, ttl=300)
        return Ok(user)
    except DatabaseError as e:
        return Err(UserError.database_error(e))
```

### 4. Documentation Generation
PSM creates accurate, context-aware documentation:

```yaml
command: "Generate API documentation for PaymentService"

psm_output:
  summary: |
    PaymentService handles all payment processing for the platform,
    supporting Stripe, PayPal, and direct bank transfers. It implements
    idempotent operations, automatic retry logic, and comprehensive
    audit logging.
  
  endpoints:
    - path: "/payments/process"
      method: "POST"
      description: |
        Processes a payment with automatic gateway selection based on
        user preferences and availability. Implements exponential backoff
        for transient failures.
      
      contracts:
        - "Payment completes within 30 seconds"
        - "Idempotency guaranteed for 24 hours"
        - "Audit log entry created for all attempts"
      
      error_handling:
        - "Insufficient funds: Returns 402 with retry-after header"
        - "Gateway timeout: Automatic failover to backup gateway"
        - "Invalid card: Returns 400 with specific error code"
```

### 5. Bug Diagnosis
PSM helps debug issues:

```yaml
symptom: "Users reporting intermittent 500 errors on checkout"

psm_investigation:
  analysis: |
    Based on the error pattern and codebase knowledge:
    - CheckoutService calls PaymentService.process()
    - PaymentService has a 5-second timeout
    - Recent commit changed database connection pooling
  
  hypothesis: |
    Database connection pool exhaustion causing timeouts
    
  evidence:
    - "Connection pool reduced from 50 to 10 in commit abc123"
    - "Checkout spawns 3 concurrent database queries"
    - "Load testing shows pool exhaustion at 4 concurrent checkouts"
  
  recommended_fix:
    - "Increase connection pool to 30"
    - "Implement connection queuing"
    - "Add connection pool monitoring"
```
