I am creating more and more code in automated ways. The old ways of system architecture documentation and code documentation don't lend themselves well to AI assisted coding, even with advanced LLM processing. I want to develop a new documentation methodology/schema/standard (whatever we should call it) that is both human and AI assistive. Let me explain. Let's say I have an application that I'm going to have to hand off to another team. If I build it correctly following the documentation schema we're going to build, an AI (like Claude Code along with internal tools like a graph db and vector db containg the right information about the software) will have a deep semantic understanding of the code to go along with the codebase itself. Meaning that any competent team shoudl be able to pick it up and run with it. This means the AI coding assistants should be aware of various relevant aspects of the application. Essentially what I'm looking for, at a base level is like an Read.me for semantic AI which references the accompnying vector and graph databases. Does this make sense. Do you have any questions before we really dive in?

Yes—this makes perfect sense. You want a machine-first, human-friendly doc standard that lets an AI assistant (plus your vector + graph stores) “load the project into its head” and hand a new team everything they need to be productive fast.

Here’s a concrete starting point you can react to. I’ll give you:

the goals and design principles,

a v0.1 schema (“SemDoc”) with file layout,

example payloads you can drop into a repo today,

the ingestion/usage model for LLMs, vector DB, and graph DB.

If you want, we can then iterate it into a formal spec site.

1) Goals & principles

Self-describing: A single, small set of files tells both humans and tools where to find deeper truth (APIs, code maps, graphs, embeddings, runbooks).

Composable: Works for monoliths and microservices; supports polyglot stacks.

Traceable: Every statement carries provenance (commit, author, date) and links back to code and tests.

Indexable: Designed to be chunked/embedded and mapped to a code-entity graph.

Stable surface: YAML/JSON first; link to rich docs, but keep the “control plane” text minimal and structured.

Incremental: v0.1 can be added to any repo in an hour; scales later.

2) SemDoc v0.1 (proposed)

Top-level files (root of each service/app repo):

/sem-doc/
  semdoc.yaml              # The “Semantic README” (SREADME)
  index.manifest.json      # Where all indices live (vector, graph, search)
  domain.graph.jsonld      # Ontology + code-entity graph schema
  capabilities.yaml        # User-facing capabilities & guardrails
  interfaces/
    http.openapi.yaml
    events.asyncapi.yaml
    queues.yaml            # Named topics/queues + message contracts
  data/
    schema.sql|prisma|orm  # DB schema source of truth (or link)
    ownership.yaml         # Datasets, PII flags, quality SLAs
  runtime/
    topology.yaml          # Deploy units, configs, env, secrets map
    sres.yaml              # SLO/SLA, alerts, runbooks
  develop/
    contribution.md
    decisions.adrs/        # ADRs (Architecture Decision Records)
    prompts/               # Canonical prompts, tools, guardrails for AI
  maps/
    code-map.json          # File->symbol->purpose map with IDs
    test-map.json          # Tests->requirements traceability

2.1 semdoc.yaml (the “Semantic README”)

Minimal, opinionated, link-rich. Machine parsable, human readable.

2.2 index.manifest.json

Tells tools where to pull context (so your assistant can fetch the right chunks/graphs deterministically).

{
  "version": "0.1",
  "collections": {
    "code_chunks": {
      "type": "vector",
      "driver": "qdrant",
      "location": "http://qdrant.local:6333",

    }
  }
}

2.3 domain.graph.jsonld (ontology + code entity schema)

Defines nodes/edges for: Service, Module, Class, Function, Endpoint, Dataset, Dashboard, Requirement, Risk, Test.

Example snippet:

{
  "@context": { "name": "http://schema.org/name" },
  "@graph": [
    { "@id": "lexi:Service", "@type": "rdfs:Class" },
    { "@id": "lexi:Module",  "@type": "rdfs:Class" },
    { "@id": "lexi:Function","@type": "rdfs:Class" },
    { "@id": "lexi:depends_on", "@type": "rdf:Property",
      "domain": "lexi:Module", "range": "lexi:Module" },
    { "@id": "lexi:implements", "@type": "rdf:Property",
      "domain": "lexi:Module", "range": "lexi:Capability" }
  ]
}

2.4 maps/code-map.json

Lightweight registry connecting files → symbols → purpose → links so AI can jump from a function name to tests, ADRs, runbooks.

[
  {
    "file": "src/generation/pipeline.ts",
    "symbols": [
      {
        "name": "buildPersonaContext",
        "kind": "function",
        "purpose": "Merge persona profile + brand rules into prompt context.",
        "capabilities": ["CAP-GEN-001"],
        "tests": ["tests/generation/pipeline.spec.ts::buildPersonaContext"],
        "graph_id": "lexi:Function/buildPersonaContext",
        "owner": "Platform Team"
      }
    ]
  }
]

2.5 interfaces/ (contracts)

OpenAPI for HTTP, AsyncAPI for events, plus a simple queues.yaml for topics, retry, DLQs, schemas.

# queues.yaml
version: "0.1"
topics:
  - name: "content.generated.v1"
    key: "tenantId"
    schema_ref: "schemas/content.generated.v1.json"
    retention: "7d"
    retry: { max_attempts: 5, backoff: "exp" }

2.6 runtime/topology.yaml

What runs where, envs, configs, and links to runbooks (great for SRE and AI agents).

services:
  - name: "generator"
    image: "registry.local/lexicroot/generator:1.8.2"
    env: ["OPENAI_API_KEY", "REDIS_URL", "POSTGRES_URL"]
    depends_on: ["redis", "postgres"]
    ports: ["8080"]
environments:
  - name: "prod"
    cluster: "eks-us-east-1"
    configRef: "secrets-manager://lexicroot/prod/"
runbooks:
  - "sem-doc/runtime/runbook-generator.md"

3) Ingestion & usage model (how tools use this)

For LLM code assistants (Claude Code / GPT):

Context kit: Read semdoc.yaml → context_kits → ai-code-assistant.

Load index.manifest.json → fetch a focused pack: the relevant OpenAPI slice, the code-map entries for the files being edited, the ADRs touching those symbols, and nearest test oracles.

Packing rules: Prefer small, authoritative chunks (e.g., a single function’s code + its code-map entry + its tests + its ADR rationale). Avoid dumping entire files unless necessary.

For vector DB:

Embed units that preserve semantics:

semdoc.yaml sections (capabilities, indices, compliance),

code-map.json entries per symbol,

ADRs (one ADR per chunk),

interface snippets per endpoint/message,

runbook steps (atomic).

Store provenance in vector metadata (repo, path, commit, author, timestamp, capability IDs).

For graph DB (Neo4j):

Create nodes from code-map, interfaces, and domain.graph.jsonld:

(:Service)-[:CONTAINS]->(:Module)-[:DECLARES]->(:Function)

(:Function)-[:TESTED_BY]->(:Test)

(:Module)-[:IMPLEMENTS]->(:Capability)

(:Endpoint)-[:HANDLED_BY]->(:Function)

(:ADR)-[:RATIONALE_FOR]->(:Change|:Capability)

Periodically re-sync on CI, keyed by commit SHA.

For humans:

Open /sem-doc/semdoc.yaml first. Every question has a link (interfaces, runbooks, ADRs).

Keep prose brief; push details to linked files that are also structured.

4) Minimal CI glue (v0.1)

Pre-commit: validate YAML/JSON schema; ensure every new file/function touched gets a code-map entry.

CI step:

Update vector indices from changed chunks.

Rebuild graph deltas (code-entity extraction → Cypher upsert).

Emit a sem-doc/build.json artifact summarizing what changed for assistants.

5) Hand-off checklist (what “done” looks like)

semdoc.yaml present and valid; owners set.

index.manifest.json resolves; indices reachable.

OpenAPI/AsyncAPI valid; endpoints and topics referenced in capabilities.yaml.

code-map.json coverage ≥ 80% of public symbols.

≥ 1 ADR for each non-obvious decision.

topology.yaml & runbooks present for prod.

Vector/graph reindex succeeded in last CI run.

A few targeted questions (so I tailor v0.2 perfectly)

Which CI do you want to target first (GitHub Actions, GitLab, Jenkins, Argo)?

Primary graph DB (Neo4j?) and vector DB (Qdrant/Weaviate/PGVector)?

Do you want JSON or YAML as the canonical format? (I defaulted to YAML for SREADME.)

Any compliance regimes to encode (HIPAA/PCI/GDPR), so we add a standard block?

Do you want me to generate JSON Schemas for semdoc.yaml, index.manifest.json, code-map.json and a CLI scaffold that validates & updates them?

If you’re good with v0.1, I can immediately generate:

the JSON Schemas,

a sem-doc init CLI (Node.js, ESM) that scaffolds files and runs validators,

a GitHub Action that builds vector and graph deltas.

You said:
Let's keep going for a while. This isn't just to hand off to teams, that's the extreme edge case that I want to prepare for. That's goal for completeness. The primary idea is to have such good semantic documentation that an AI coding assistant (to be determined later) will be able to "read along" with the documentation while making feature changes, adding new features, etc. so it doesn't break one thing while fixing another. The proposed system should add the semantic documentation, possibly even in-line with the code, like a doc blocks on steroids in order to assist AI code assistants to highest extent practical within hardware and general system limitations.

ChatGPT said:
Thought for 55s

Awesome—let’s level this up into SemDoc v0.2 with inline, machine-actionable “SemBlocks” that ride alongside your code (doc-blocks on steroids), plus the repo-level control plane you already saw. Goal: an AI code assistant can “read along” while editing and reliably avoid collateral damage.

I’ll give you:

What a SemBlock is and where it lives

The SemBlock schema (concise but expressive)

Language examples (TypeScript, PHP 8.2, Python)

Packing rules for AI assistants (how to “read along”)

CI guardrails + graph/vector ingestion

Adoption plan (incremental, low friction)

1) SemBlocks (inline semantic doc blocks)

What: A structured JSON (or YAML) payload embedded inside a normal comment directly above a file, class, or function.

Why: Gives the assistant explicit purpose, contracts, effects, dependencies, flags, telemetry, tests, and risk—everything it needs to edit safely.

How: Language-idiomatic comment wrappers, but the inner payload is schema-validated JSON so tools can parse it reliably.

Placement:

File-level SemBlock (module scope) at the top of the file.

Symbol-level SemBlocks for public classes/functions/methods exported from the module.

Each SemBlock gets a stable graph_id that maps to the graph DB.

2) SemBlock schema (v0.2, minimal set)

Keep each block ~200–800 tokens. Split into multiple blocks if needed.

{
  "version": "0.2",
  "graph_id": "lexi:Function/buildPersonaContext",   // stable ID used in graph DB
  "summary": "Merge persona profile + brand rules into a prompt context.",
  "capabilities": ["CAP-GEN-001"],                   // ties to sem-doc/capabilities.yaml
  "stage": "stable",                                  // draft|experimental|stable|deprecated
  "inputs": [

    "reads": ["redis:persona:{id}", "kv:brand_rules:{brandId}"],
    "writes": ["event:context_built"],
    "calls": ["BrandRules.get", "mergeBrandPolicies"]
  },
  "invariants": [
    "no PII leaked to logs",
    "idempotent for same inputs"
  ],
  "perf_budget": { "p95_ms": 50, "alloc_mb": 10 },
  "security": {
    "authz": ["role:generator"], 
    "pii": "none"
  },
  "feature_flags": ["persona_context_v2"],           // flags that gate behavior
  "telemetry": [
    { "event": "context_built", "props": ["tenantId","personaId","rulesVersion"] }
  ],
  "tests": {
    "oracles": [
      "tests/generation/pipeline.spec.ts::buildPersonaContext_returnsExpectedShape"
    ],
    "fixtures": ["fixtures/persona_min.json"]
  },
  "dependencies": ["lexi:Module/BrandRules"],
  "migration": { "since": "2025-09-01", "replaces": "lexi:Function/buildContextV1" },
  "risk_notes": [

  "provenance": { "author": "Platform Team", "commit": "9a1b7c4", "last_reviewed": "2025-09-01" }
}


Field purpose (in practice):

inputs/output/pre/post/invariants → contracts the assistant must preserve.

effects.reads/writes/calls → read/write sets for impact analysis and test selection.

feature_flags → where to branch safely.

telemetry → events that must keep firing (great for canaries).

tests.oracles/fixtures → what to run before/after edit.

guard.noedit/reviewers → hard stops or human gate.

perf_budget → stop the assistant from adding quadratic “helpers.”

4) “Read-along” packing rules for the AI assistant

When the assistant edits symbol X:

Load local SemBlock for X.

Add nearest context:

The file-level SemBlock,

Any upstream dependencies SemBlocks (one hop),

Any downstream writes targets (e.g., events, tables),

The ADR (if referenced) that explains the rule you’re about to touch.

Pull tests.oracles + fixtures mentioned by the SemBlock.

Pull feature_flags definitions and their current defaults.

Observe perf_budget, invariants, security.pii.

Generate a SemChangePlan (mini plan) before code changes:

# sem-changeplan.yaml (ephemeral in the PR/patch comment)
target: "lexi:Function/buildPersonaContext"
intent: "Add brand policy v2 merge path; keep v1 under flag off by default"
impacts:
  reads: ["kv:brand_rules:{brandId}"]
  writes: ["event:context_built"]    # unchanged
  contracts:
    preserves: ["idempotent for same inputs", "no PII in logs"]
    updates: []
tests:
  must_pass:
    - tests/generation/pipeline.spec.ts::buildPersonaContext_returnsExpectedShape
  add:
    - tests/generation/pipeline.spec.ts::respects_v2_flag
flags:
  introduce: ["persona_context_v2"]
risk: "low"


Only after the plan is accepted (by bot or human rule), produce the diff.

Re-run oracles and prove postconditions (quick property tests are great).

If a contract must change, update the SemBlock in the same diff and flag reviewers.

5) CI guardrails + ingestion

Validation (pre-commit / CI):

Parse all SemBlocks via semblock.schema.json.

Enforce coverage: every exported symbol must have a SemBlock (configurable threshold).

Check contract drift: if code references change input/output types or public signatures, fail unless SemBlock updated.

Enforce noedit guards and reviewer lists.

Graph & vector sync (CI job):

Extract SemBlocks → upsert to Neo4j:

(:Function {graph_id})-[:DEPENDS_ON]->(:Module|:Function)

(:Function)-[:WRITES]->(:Event|:Table)

(:Function)-[:TESTED_BY]->(:Test)

Chunk SemBlocks + linked ADR/test snippets into Qdrant with metadata:

{graph_id, file, symbol, capability, commit, stage}

Impact selection:

On PR, compute read/write/calls neighborhood (≤2 hops) to pick tests to run and owners to ping.

Quality gates:

Contracts satisfied (postconditions verified in tests/property checks).

Perf budgets respected (microbench or profiling smoke).

Telemetry events still emitted with required props.

6) Adoption plan (incremental)

Level 0 – Seed

Add file-level SemBlock to each critical module (purpose, capabilities, owners).

Add SemBlocks to top 10 “risky” functions (side effects, invariants).

Level 1 – Contracts

Fill inputs/output/pre/post/invariants/effects.

Add at least one tests.oracle per function.

Level 2 – Operations

Add perf_budget, telemetry, feature_flags, security.

Level 3 – Automation

Turn on CI validation + graph/vector sync.

Require a SemChangePlan for edits to stage: stable functions.

Where this fits the repo control plane

sem-doc/semdoc.yaml still declares indices, capabilities, and owners.

sem-doc/maps/code-map.json can be auto-generated from SemBlocks:

each SemBlock contributes file → symbol → graph_id → tests.

sem-doc/domain.graph.jsonld remains the ontology the SemBlocks map onto.

Tiny JSON Schema (starter)
{
  "$schema": "https://json-schema.org/draft/2020-12/schema",
  "$id": "https://example.com/semblock.schema.json",
  "type": "object",
  "required": ["version", "graph_id", "summary"],
  "properties": {
    "version": { "const": "0.2" },
    "graph_id": { "type": "string", "minLength": 3 },
    "summary": { "type": "string", "minLength": 5 },
    "capabilities": { "type": "array", "items": { "type": "string" } },
    "inputs": { "type": "array", "items": { "type": "object" } },

    "feature_flags": { "type": "array", "items": { "type": "string" } },
    "telemetry": { "type": "array", "items": { "type": "object" } },
    "tests": { "type": "object" },
    "dependencies": { "type": "array", "items": { "type": "string" } },
    "migration": { "type": "object" },
    "risk_notes": { "type": "array", "items": { "type": "string" } },
    "guard": { "type": "object" },
    "provenance": { "type": "object" }
  },
  "additionalProperties": false
}

Editor/assistant integration (practical)

Pack heuristics (JetBrains/VSCode/Claude Code plugin or a simple CLI):

When user edits a function: fetch its SemBlock + the one-hop SemBlocks from the graph and the referenced tests/ADRs.

Respect max tokens by prioritizing in this order:

symbol SemBlock → 2) file SemBlock → 3) tests.oracles → 4) ADR snippet → 5) dependent SemBlocks → 6) telemetry/flags.

Assistant guardrails:

If guard.noedit == true → propose SemChangePlan only.

If changing contracts: must update SemBlock in the same diff, otherwise block.

Emit a Change Summary comment listing invariants preserved and impacts.

Extras you’ll likely enjoy later

Signed SemBlocks (hash in CI) to catch tampering/prompt-injection in comments.

Red-team invariants: negative property tests automatically generated from pre/post.

Runtime canaries: compare telemetry schema declared vs. observed.

Doc debt dashboards: surface modules missing SemBlocks or with stale provenance.

If you want, I can turn this into:

a ready-to-drop semblock.schema.json,

a Node.js (ESM) sem-doc CLI that scans/validates/extracts SemBlocks and updates Neo4j/Qdrant,

and a GitHub Action you can paste into .github/workflows/sem-doc.yml.

Or we can immediately start by SemBlocking 2–3 representative files from your current project to prove the loop end-to-end.

You said:
Now, let's carry this a step further. Not only will the semantic documentation be critical, but would it be crazy to think that each code base would have it's own it's own tiny LLM to work with a more general coding assistant? I think this would require more than just a graph and vector database, it would acutally need to go through a training process and monitor QA, tests, past failures, and be able to track the entire SDLC from day one. For existing products, it would be able to learn from past commits and other records. Discuss.
ChatGPT said:
Thought for 6s

Love this direction. A per-repo “tiny LLM” that co-pilots with a general assistant isn’t crazy at all—it’s the logical next step once you have SemBlocks + vector/graph context. Think of it as a Project Specialist Model (PSM) that knows your codebase’s idioms, invariants, and scars, while the general model (Claude/GPT/etc.) brings broad reasoning and coding prowess.

Here’s a practical blueprint.

Concept

General Assistant (GA): big, smart, up-to-date; great at synthesis and nonlocal reasoning.

Project Specialist Model (PSM): small, local, continually adapted to this repo’s APIs, patterns, tests, conventions, and pitfalls.

Retrieval & Graph: ground both models with precise, fresh context (SemBlocks, code graph, vector chunks).

Feedback Loop: CI/test results, code review comments, incidents, and runtime telemetry continuously shape the PSM.

Why a tiny per-repo model?

Latency + privacy: runs colocated with code/CI; no external leakage.

Idioms & constraints: preserves invariants, flags, and house style better than a general model prompted from scratch every time.

Tool-aware: learns your test oracles, perf budgets, and feature flags; refuses risky edits unless the plan accounts for them.

High-level architecture

SemDoc layer (from our earlier spec)

SemBlocks inline; repo-level semdoc.yaml, code-map.json, graph schema.

Guarantees machine-readable contracts for the PSM.

Context Fabric

Vector DB (e.g., Qdrant) for SemBlock chunks, ADRs, tests, runbooks.

Graph DB (Neo4j) for entities: Functions, Modules, Tests, Endpoints, Flags, Datasets; edges for depends_on / writes / tested_by.

Experience Replay DB (Postgres/ClickHouse)

Stores episodes: {prompt/context → code diff → tests run → outcomes → review notes → telemetry deltas}.

Also stores failure exemplars and hotfix traces.

PSM (tiny LLM)

A small code-capable base (e.g., 3–8B class; quantized if desired).

Adapted via LoRA/QLoRA or adapters; no full fine-tune required initially.

Lives next to CI and IDE gateway; receives short inputs and structured contexts.

Orchestrator (Router)

Decides per request: GA-only, PSM-only, or hybrid (PSM drafts + GA review, or GA plan + PSM implement).

Enforces packing rules: pull SemBlocks, nearest tests, perf budgets, flags, graph neighborhood.

Evaluation + Safety

Automated evals (unit/integration), property tests from SemBlocks postconditions, perf checks vs. budgets.

Red-team contracts (negative tests).

Secret scanning and policy guardrails.

Data sources for training/adaptation

Code history: commits, diffs, messages, branches, tags.

CI/CD artifacts: which tests fail for which diffs; flaky tests; runtime perf regressions.

Reviews: PR comments, “requested changes” → gold feedback.

Incidents: root-cause docs, runbooks touched, mitigations.

SemBlocks: inputs/outputs, invariants, effects, tests.oracles, perf_budget, feature_flags.

Interfaces: OpenAPI/AsyncAPI/queues; schema drift & compatibility notes.

Turn these into supervised pairs and critic signals:

Instruction tuning pairs: “Implement X subject to invariants Y/Z” → accepted diff + passing tests.

Anti-patterns: “Don’t do W in function F because invariant I” → rejected diff + explanation.

Self-consistency: “Given this SemBlock, generate tests” ↔ “Given tests, generate missing SemBlock fields.”

Training & adaptation strategy
Phase 0: No-train (Prompt-Only)

Keep PSM as a router to GA but with aggressive, structured prompting using SemBlocks + graph.

Benefits: zero infra burden; tests and contracts already reduce blast radius.

Phase 1: Lightweight adapters (recommended starter)

Choose a small code model (examples: Phi-3.5 3B, Qwen2.5-Coder-7B, Llama-3.1-Instruct-8B).

Train LoRA adapters on your episodes + curated “golden” PRs (accepted edits with passing tests).

Focus tasks:

“Write a SemChangePlan for this function change.”

“Refactor function F without breaking invariants.”

“Add tests satisfying postconditions for F.”

Keep base frozen; swap adapters per repo (or per domain).

Phase 2: Continual finetune (optional)

Nightly/weekly adapter refresh from new episodes; small learning rate, heavy eval gate.

Maintain adapter registry by repo@commit-range.

Phase 3: Distillation & hybrid skills (optional)

Distill GA reasoning chains into PSM for frequent patterns (“how we do feature flag rollouts,” “how we guard PII,” etc.).

Add toolformer-style hints: when to run test selection, graph queries, or openAPI calls.

Serving & workflow

IDE plugin / CLI (router)

Developer selects function/file → router pulls SemBlocks + graph 1-hop + tests.

Router queries vector DB to add a few ADR/test snippets.

Policy: if guard.noedit → only allow SemChangePlan.

Collab patterns

GA-plan → PSM-implement → GA-review (default for complex edits).

PSM-draft → tests → GA-repair (fast path for local idioms).

PSM-only for small, stylistic refactors within strict contracts.

CI gates

Validate SemBlocks; run impact tests chosen by graph.

Check perf_budget and telemetry emission.

Auto-label PR with risk and affected capabilities.

On pass, log an episode to Experience DB for future adaptation.

Evaluation framework (keep it ruthless)

Offline eval suites (run before adapters go live):

Contract adherence: measured by property tests derived from SemBlocks postconditions.

Behavioral regressions: known tricky edits; ensure PSM doesn’t re-introduce historical bugs.

Perf regressions: microbench harness per module.

Style/idiom: lint rules and custom heuristics.

Online eval signals:

First-pass test pass-rate; mean review iterations; revert rate; time-to-green.

“Invariant break attempts” caught by validator (trend should go to zero).

Telemetry schema drift alarms.

Infra you likely already have (and how to slot this in)

Vector: Qdrant (collections: semblocks, adrs, tests, failures).

Graph: Neo4j (Function, Test, Endpoint, Flag, Dataset).

Experience DB: Postgres (OLTP) + ClickHouse (analytics) for episodes.

Runner: A small GPU/CPU node per repo group; PSM served via vLLM/text-generation-inference.

Orchestrator: Node.js (ESM) microservice that the IDE and CI call.

Minimal schemas (practical)

Experience Episode (Postgres)

-- episodes
CREATE TABLE psm_episode (
  id BIGSERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  repo TEXT NOT NULL,
  commit_sha TEXT,
  graph_id TEXT,               -- principal symbol
  intent TEXT,                 -- human or GA intent
  context JSONB,               -- SemBlocks pulled, tests list, flags
  prompt TEXT,                 -- model-visible prompt
  draft_diff TEXT,             -- PSM output
  finalized_diff TEXT,         -- after GA/human edits
  tests_run JSONB,             -- list + results
  outcome TEXT CHECK (outcome IN ('pass','fail','partial')),
  review_notes JSONB,          -- extracted from PR comments
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT now()
);


SemBlock extraction (already defined) becomes training/control metadata (graph_id, capabilities, invariants, etc.).

Security & privacy guardrails

No secrets in training: scrub diffs and logs; use secret scanners; exclude certain files/patterns.

Access control: PSM only serves within your network; adapters encrypted at rest.

Data minimization: keep only necessary fields in Experience DB; purge per retention policy in semdoc.yaml.

Provenance: every adapter build ties to commit SHAs and episode hashes.

Costs & sizing (rule-of-thumb)

A 7B adapter (QLoRA) fine-tune on a few thousand episodes: a single 24–48GB GPU (or rented cloud) for ~1–3 hours per refresh.

Serving: 7B int4 runs comfortably on a single consumer GPU; CPU-only is possible with latency tradeoffs.

Storage: Episodes are cheap (mostly text), vectors a few GB, graph small.

MVP plan (1–2 weeks of focused work)

Wire the router: implement packing rules from SemBlocks + graph; add GA-plan → PSM-implement flow (PSM can be a stub initially).

Experience logging: capture prompts, diffs, test results, review notes.

Gold set: curate ~100 solid PRs (accepted, passing) as seed training.

Adapter v0: train a LoRA on two tasks: (a) SemChangePlan generation, (b) small safe refactors respecting invariants.

Eval: run the offline suite + shadow-mode in CI for a week.

Gradual enablement: turn on PSM for low-risk modules only; expand by capability.

How this pairs with SemDoc v0.2

SemBlocks become the curriculum (contracts) and scaffold (packing).

The PSM learns how your repo solves problems under those contracts.

The GA provides deep reasoning and multi-repo knowledge; the PSM keeps edits inside the guardrails and in your house style.

If you want, I can spin up:

a Node.js (ESM) “router” skeleton (Express + simple adapters manager),

a PSM training script (QLoRA) with a tiny dataset spec drawn from SemBlocks + Episodes,

and a GitHub Action that packages the latest adapter and runs the eval suite.

Say the word and I’ll drop the scaffolds (config files + minimal code) you can paste into your repo.

I want to add one more aspect along with a good/bad/ugly discussion. Not only an LLM per codebase, but an LLM for a collection of code bases. The problem I see with that in some instances is that if a particular product is sold off to another company, you can't just untrain the collection LLM. There might be serious legal and contractual issues with that. Discuss.
ChatGPT said:

Great point—this gets into the governance and legal side of per-repo vs. cross-repo LLMs. Let’s break it down into the good / bad / ugly tradeoffs of having one model per codebase vs. a “portfolio model” across multiple repos.

✅ The Good (portfolio LLM)

Cross-pollination of patterns:
A collection model learns shared idioms, tooling, libraries, deployment pipelines, and organizational style. Faster onboarding, less re-inventing the wheel.

Economies of scale:
Instead of retraining/adapting a dozen per-repo models, you maintain a single larger one, fed by all repos. Cheaper infra + less operational overhead.

Better architectural reasoning:
A portfolio LLM sees inter-service contracts (e.g., shared APIs, message queues, feature flag rollouts) across products. That makes it stronger at refactorings or cross-cutting changes.

Common guardrails & governance:
Security invariants, logging practices, compliance rules (GDPR, HIPAA) get reinforced because the LLM sees them in many repos.

⚠️ The Bad (portfolio LLM)

Data leakage risk:
If Repo A has proprietary algorithms, Repo B’s devs (or the GA assistant) might get responses biased by that knowledge—even if they shouldn’t.

Update & drift issues:
A portfolio LLM tuned on N repos gets stale faster, because one repo might evolve faster than another. Adapters per repo may still be needed.

Over-generalization:
It may learn “average patterns” across repos, but miss repo-specific quirks. Risk: generic advice that ignores special constraints captured in SemBlocks.

Scaling governance:
Who approves what goes into the shared model? CI noise or bad commits in one repo might degrade the model for everyone.

💀 The Ugly (legal / contractual)

Divestiture problem (your point):
If Product X is sold off, its code and data must transfer. But if its “knowledge” is baked into a multi-repo model, you can’t untrain that without retraining from scratch.
→ Could be seen as IP leakage or breach of contract.

Regulated domains:
If Repo A is HIPAA-related and Repo B is not, mixing them could put you in violation if the shared LLM learns PHI-adjacent patterns.

License pollution:
If one repo uses code under restrictive license (GPL, internal patent), training a shared model might contaminate others with “derivative works” risk.

Litigation exposure:
In an M&A due diligence, buyers will ask: “Show us that none of our proprietary IP has been mixed into unrelated ML artifacts.” Hard to prove without very clean per-repo separation.

Practical middle ground

Repo-first adapters, portfolio-second base.

Train/adapt per-repo PSMs (tiny LoRA adapters).

Optionally have a portfolio base adapter that captures cross-cutting patterns only (e.g., internal frameworks, logging conventions).

Repo adapters = attach/detach cleanly → no “untrain” problem.

Hierarchical routing.

General assistant → (repo router) → per-repo PSM.

If task spans repos (e.g., service contract refactor), GA queries the portfolio adapter but still pulls authoritative context from SemBlocks.

Data tenancy enforcement.

Each SemDoc (semdoc.yaml) declares data_tenancy: isolated|shared.

CI pipelines enforce: only “shared” repos feed portfolio adapter; “isolated” feed their own PSMs.

Legal escape hatch.

Keep PSM adapters per repo portable (on sale, ship adapter + experience DB + SemDocs).

Portfolio model contains only open/shared patterns (frameworks, infrastructure, org-wide coding style). No repo-specific business logic.

⚖️ Recommendation

For now: Stick to per-repo PSMs as the primary unit. Safer legally, clean operationally.

For shared knowledge: Maintain a framework/core adapter trained only on reusable libraries, scaffolds, and SemBlocks flagged as shared: true.

Governance: Every repo’s sem-doc/semdoc.yaml should carry a tenancy flag so CI knows what can be shared upstream.

Contractual defense: When selling Product X, you can hand over its PSM + vectors + graphs and prove the portfolio model contains no repo-specific IP.

👉 Question for you: would you like me to sketch how the repo-level SemDoc schema could be extended with a tenancy / shareability block (so CI knows what feeds into portfolio training and what stays isolated)? That way we’d have a built-in legal/compliance mechanism from day one.

You said:
No, let's keep going. I'm also of the opinion that current Agile and sprint methodologies along with tickets and either agile or kanban boards, etc. are going to be completely outmoded. There are of course backlogs, feature requests, bugs to fix and general refactors of code to make things generally better to consider. All the tech debt stuff. While considering the SemDoc stuff, let's also consider a whole new way to track the SDLC which is, in light of an efficient AI coding assistant world, greatly sped up if done correctly. Agile itself must be changed or eliminated in favor of a more efficient AI aware system. Honestly, I'm not even sure how this should be done. Give me some ideas. Keep in mind, this will have to to be done in conjunction with, at the very least, codebase specific LLMs. Hit me.
ChatGPT said:

Perfect—this is the natural extension. If the codebase itself is semantically annotated (SemDoc + SemBlocks) and there’s a PSM (Project Specialist Model) sitting next to it, then Agile-as-we-know-it (tickets, boards, ceremonies) is indeed redundant baggage.

What replaces it needs to be:

AI-aware: every change, bug, or request can be understood and triaged by AI.

Continuous: no artificial sprint boundaries; work flows when needed.

Contractual: every change is tied back to capabilities, invariants, and risk budgets (SemDoc).

Feedback-looped: test runs, telemetry, user signals feed directly back into prioritization.

Here are some ideas for a post-Agile, AI-native SDLC.

1. Replace Tickets with Change Intents

Instead of Jira tickets, you log a Change Intent (CI).

A CI is a structured artifact that looks like:

id: CI-2025-00123
intent: "Add ability for persona_context_v2 to merge fallback rules."
linked_capability: CAP-GEN-001
type: feature|bugfix|refactor|techdebt
constraints:
  - must_preserve: ["no PII logs", "idempotent"]
  - perf_budget: { p95_ms: 50 }
tests:
  must_extend: ["tests/generation/pipeline.spec.ts"]
priority: auto    # delegated to PSM triage
risk: auto        # inferred from graph impact + invariants
status: proposed|in-progress|in-review|done


This replaces a user story or bug ticket.

It’s machine-parsable → AI can “claim” it, reason about dependencies, and propose a SemChangePlan.

2. Replace Sprints with Flow & Epics-as-Capabilities

Forget 2-week sprints. Instead:

Capabilities (from capabilities.yaml) are your “epics.”

Change Intents flow continuously; no artificial cadence.

PSM + orchestrator monitor capacity (CI/CD throughput, test queue size, human review availability) and throttle intake.

Planning becomes:

Where do we invest? (Choose which capabilities to extend).

What’s blocked? (Dependencies in graph DB).

No grooming/standups; instead dashboards update in real time from repo state + SemDoc indices.

3. Replace Kanban with a Change State Machine

Each Change Intent auto-progresses:

proposed → planned → SemChangePlan → draft_diff → tested → merged → monitored


Each transition is validated by:

SemDoc contracts (SemBlocks).

PSM (generates plans/drafts).

CI system (runs impact-selected tests).

Humans (approve high-risk diffs flagged by risk budget).

Telemetry (post-merge monitoring confirms invariants hold in prod).

This state machine replaces the Kanban board. Instead of sticky notes, you watch CIs flow.

4. Backlog & Prioritization = AI-driven queues

Backlog isn’t groomed manually.

Inputs:

Feature requests (natural language, auto-tagged to capabilities).

Bug reports (logs/tests/telemetry anomalies auto-ingested).

Tech debt (PSM/GA propose refactors where invariants/complexity look risky).

AI prioritizes by:

Graph impact (dependencies, blast radius).

Telemetry (what breaks most often).

Business tags (priority fields in SemDoc).

Humans steer the backlog by setting weights → “optimize for stability vs. velocity.”

5. SDLC Roles → AI + Humans as Co-agents

AI PSM: handles routine Change Intents, generates SemChangePlans, drafts diffs, runs tests.

General Assistant (GA): handles novel reasoning, cross-repo refactors, synthesizes ADRs.

Humans:

Set intentions (high-level goals, priority weights).

Review only risky changes (contract updates, invariant breaks, perf budget breaches).

Handle business-facing design work, product strategy, compliance.

Result: humans focus on what and why, AI covers how and when.

6. Tracking Tech Debt = Contract Drift & Risk Heatmaps

Instead of “tech debt tickets”:

SemDoc validator measures coverage (functions without SemBlocks, stale provenance).

Drift metrics:

% of invariants not tested,

perf budget violations,

functions with missing telemetry.

Visualize as heatmaps in the graph.

AI generates Debt Intents to remediate automatically (refactor proposals).

7. Release Management = Capability Gates

No more sprint reviews/releases.

Each Capability in capabilities.yaml has:

SLOs (availability, perf budgets).

Guardrails (invariants, flags).

Release readiness check (all CIs tied to it pass tests + monitoring).

When ready, the system auto-tags a release branch → deployable artifact.

8. Governance & Legal Hooks

Each CI and SemChangePlan is fully traceable → commit, tests, reviewer, invariants, risk notes.

You can prove in an audit:

This bugfix was scoped correctly.

This function never leaked PII because SemBlock contract prevented it.

This repo never mixed with others (tenancy flag enforced).

🔮 What this gives you (vs. Agile)

From pull → push: Work comes from telemetry + AI analysis, not humans dragging tickets.

From sprints → flow: Continuous, contract-checked change, not 2-week cycles.

From backlogs → priority queues: AI sorts by risk/impact automatically.

From ceremonies → state machine: Progress is visible in code + tests, not meetings.

From tickets → Change Intents: Contracts + invariants baked in; AI and humans can collaborate without translation overhead.

🌱 Incremental way to test this

Keep your current Agile/Kanban boards.

Start logging Change Intents alongside tickets (YAML + SemDoc).

Let the PSM try handling low-risk Intents (e.g., minor bugfixes).

Watch how much manual grooming/ceremony you can strip away.

Transition once Change Intents & SemDoc give you higher velocity + better safety than tickets.

👉 Do you want me to sketch out what a Change Intent schema + minimal CI state machine workflow (e.g., YAML + Node.js service) would look like? That could be your first replacement for Jira/GitHub Issues in this new system.

Expand on the SemDoc contracts.
ChatGPT said:
Thought for 6s

Awesome—let’s turn the “contracts” idea into something crisp and enforceable. Below is SemDoc Contracts v0.3: a precise, machine-parsable specification you can drop into SemBlocks and repo-level SemDoc to keep AI assistants (and humans) inside the guardrails.

I’ll cover:

What a Contract is & where it lives

The Contract object (fields + mini-DSL)

Effect taxonomy (reads/writes/calls)

Failure, concurrency, and performance semantics

Security/PII, config/flags, compatibility/versioning

Tests, telemetry, and CI enforcement

Reusable “contract packs” (patterns)

Worked examples (TypeScript, PHP 8.2, HTTP endpoint)

JSON Schema starter

1) What is a SemDoc Contract?

A Contract is the authoritative, machine-readable statement of what a symbol (function, method, endpoint, handler) requires, guarantees, and affects:

Preconditions: what must be true to call it

Postconditions: what it guarantees on success

Invariants: properties that must never be violated (across calls)

Effects: all side effects and resource interactions (reads/writes/calls)

Perf/limits: budgets and rate/size limits

Security: authN/Z, PII handling, data residency

Compat: versioning guarantees, migration notes

Tests/telemetry: oracles to validate; events/metrics it must emit

Contracts live inline as SemBlocks (doc-block JSON) and optionally summarized at module/capability level in /sem-doc.

2) Contract object (fields + mini-DSL)

Use these fields inside a SemBlock under "contract": { ... }.

"contract": {
  "stage": "stable",                       // draft|experimental|stable|deprecated
  "inputs": [
    {"name":"profile","type":"Persona","pre":["nonNull","profile.brandId.exists"]}
  ],
  "output": {
    "type":"Context",
    "post":[
      "result.brand.id == profile.brandId",
      "len(result.rules) >= 1"
    ],
    "errors":[
      {"when":"profile.missing","throws":"InvalidArgument","message":"profile required"},
      {"when":"brandRules.lookup.fail","throws":"UpstreamUnavailable","retryable":true}
    ]
  },
  "invariants":[
    "noPII(logs)",
    "idempotent(profile,brandRules.version)",
    "pureWithinBudget(50ms,10MB)"
  ],
  "effects":{
    "reads":["redis:persona:{id}","kv:brand_rules:{brandId}"],
    "writes":["event:context_built"],
    "calls":["BrandRules.get"]
  },
  "concurrency":{
    "reentrancy":"nonReentrant",           // nonReentrant|reentrant|stateless
    "idempotencyKey":"profile.id+rules.version",
    "lock":"none"                          // none|advisory(db)|distributed(redis)
  },
  "performance":{
    "p95_ms":50,"p99_ms":120,"alloc_mb":10,"max_req_per_min":600
  },
  "security":{
    "authn":"serviceToken",
    "authz":["role:generator"],
    "pii":"none",
    "secrets":["env:OPENAI_API_KEY"],
    "data_residency":"US"
  },
  "feature_flags":["persona_context_v2"],
  "config":[
    {"key":"rules.maxDepth","type":"int","default":5,"range":"[1,10]"}
  ],
  "compat":{
    "since":"1.8.0",
    "semver":"minor",
    "backward":"wireCompatible",
    "forward":"tolerant",
    "deprecation":null
  },
  "telemetry":{
    "events":[
      {"name":"context_built","props":["tenantId","personaId","rulesVersion"],"sample":1.0}
    ],
    "metrics":[
      {"name":"pipeline.time_ms","type":"histogram"}
    ],
    "logs":[{"level":"info","schema":"noPII"}]
  },
  "tests":{
    "oracles":[
      "tests/generation/pipeline.spec.ts::returnsExpectedShape"
    ],
    "property":[
      "∀p:Persona . profile.brandId != null ⇒ build(p,br).brand.id == p.brandId"
    ],
    "fixtures":["fixtures/persona_min.json"]
  },
  "provenance":{"author":"Platform","last_reviewed":"2025-09-01"}
}

Mini-DSL cheatsheet (for pre/post/invariants)

Predicates: nonNull, nonEmpty, uuid, email, <=, >=, len(x), exists

Result: refer to function return value as result

PII/log helpers: noPII(logs), noSecrets(logs)

Pure/idempotent: pure, idempotent(args...), pureWithinBudget(ms,MB)

Temporal: eventually(within: '5s', expr) (for async handlers)

3) Effect taxonomy (crucial for impact analysis)

Use canonical resource schemes so tools can reason about blast radius:

Datastores

db:<table> (SQL), coll:<collection> (NoSQL)

index:<name> (search), blob:<bucket>/<prefix> (object)

Caches/queues

redis:<key>, cache:<namespace>

topic:<name>, queue:<name>, event:<name>

Network

http:<service>/<endpoint>, grpc:<service>/<method>

Filesystem/OS

fs:<path>, proc:<capability>

Secrets/Config

secret:<name>, config:<key>

Telemetry

metric:<name>, log:<schema>, event:<name>

Effects allow: test selection, reviewer routing, and CI safety checks.

4) Failure, concurrency, performance semantics
Failure modes (output.errors)

throws: canonical error class

when: guard expression (human/AI readable)

retryable: hint for orchestrators

Rule: all thrown errors in code must map to a declared error (or CI flags unknown).

Concurrency

reentrancy: can the function safely call itself/overlap?

idempotencyKey: exact key that yields idempotent behavior (used by routers)

lock: advisory/distributed lock declaration

Performance

Budgets: p95_ms, p99_ms, alloc_mb

Rate limits: max_req_per_min, or per caller class

Rule: if an edit increases p95 beyond budget, CI fails unless contract updated + risk accepted.

5) Security/PII, config/flags, compatibility/versioning

security: authn method, roles, PII class (none|basic|sensitive), residency, secret dependencies.

config: keys + types with defaults and ranges → assistants won’t “hardcode” magic numbers.

feature_flags: toggles that gate code paths; assistants must branch safely.

compat: semver contract, wire/backward/forward compatibility rules, deprecation timelines.

6) Tests, telemetry, and CI enforcement

Tests

oracles: explicit test cases to run before/after edits

property: quickcheck/property tests derived from pre/post/invariants

fixtures: canonical inputs; assistants can request/extend them

Telemetry

events/metrics/logs schema must match emitted data; CI validates shape via contract → test assertions.

CI enforcement (gates)

Validate JSON against schema; reject unknown fields.

Signature drift: if code signature changes, contract must update in same PR.

Effects drift: added/deleted side effects must be reflected.

Perf: microbench smoke vs. budget (fail if regresses).

Security: secret usage must match security.secrets.

Coverage: exported symbols must have contracts (threshold configurable).

7) Reusable “Contract Packs” (drop-in presets)

Shortcuts you can include by reference in a SemBlock:

pureFunction

invariants: ["pure","noPII(logs)"]; effects: {reads:[],writes:[],calls:[]}
performance: {p95_ms<=5}


idempotentCommand

invariants:["idempotent(args)"]; concurrency:{idempotencyKey:"<expr>"}
effects:{writes:["db:<table>"]}; output.errors includes retryable network/storage


readThroughCache

effects:{reads:["cache:<ns>","db:<table>"],writes:["cache:<ns>"]}
invariants:["cacheMiss ⇒ single db read"]


sagaStep

effects:{writes:["event:<name>"]}; invariants:["compensate on failure"]
telemetry.events:["<name>_start","<name>_done","<name>_compensate"]


streamHandler

inputs:[{...,pre:["offset monotonic"]}]
invariants:["atLeastOnce or exactlyOnce"]; performance:{p99_ms per message}


Reference packs in a block:

"extends": ["pack:pureFunction","pack:readThroughCache"]

How assistants use Contracts (practical loop)

When editing a symbol:

Load its SemBlock contract.

Plan the edit (SemChangePlan) that explicitly cites which pre/post/invariants it touches and any effects added/removed.

Generate code respecting perf/security budgets.

Run impact tests chosen from effects & tests.oracles; auto-create property tests from post.

If contract must change, update it in the same diff and request human review (risk elevated).

Verify telemetry events/props still fire; fail if schema drifts.

If you want, I can package this into:

a semcontract.schema.json file,

a tiny Node.js ESM validator (CLI + pre-commit hook), and

a GitHub Action that enforces drift (signature/effects/perf/security) and auto-generates property tests from post expressions.

You said:
I do realize that code versioning isn't going anywhere nor should it and git is the gold standard and that's not going anywhere, so all of the above needs to work with git (gitlab, bitbucket, etc.) but make the commit messages themselves also semantically documented just like the code. An AI assistant could then quickly scan through git histories, and even ingest those into graph/vector for even better understanding. I don't need code, just discuss.
ChatGPT said:
Thought for 9s

Love it. Think of this as the missing third leg: Code (SemBlocks) · Change Intents · Commits. If SemBlocks are what the code must always honor, commits should be what actually changed, why, and with what blast radius—in a format that both humans and AIs can reason over and feed into graph/vector storage.

Here’s a practical design you can adopt without throwing Git away.

Why “semantic commits”

Machine triage: an assistant can scan history to find similar edits, regressions, and hotfix patterns.

Traceability-by-default: each change ties to capabilities, contracts, risk, tests, telemetry, flags.

Better retrieval: commits become high-signal chunks for vector search; edges for the code graph (“this commit touched these invariants and tables”).

SemCommit (v1) — a structured commit message standard

Keep the normal human subject line. Add a structured footer the way Git trailers or Conventional Commits footers work. Human-first up top; machine-first below.

Human subject (72 chars max)

A crisp summary, present tense, imperative.

Compatible with Conventional Commits (optional): feat(cap-gen-001): …, fix(api): …

Machine footer (key: value trailers)

One key per line; values can be JSON/YAML for complex fields.

Order is stable so parsers are trivial.

Suggested fields (use as many as you need):

Change-Intent: ID of the Change Intent (or ad-hoc)

Scope: repo path(s) or subsystem (e.g., src/generation, payments)

Graph-IDs: comma list of SemBlock graph_ids touched

Capabilities: list (e.g., CAP-GEN-001)

Contract-Delta: JSON pointer to contracts added/changed/removed (pre/post/invariants/effects)

Effects: canonical read/write/call sets added/removed (e.g., +writes: event:context_built ; -reads: kv:legacy_rules:*)

Flags: feature flags introduced/used/removed

Perf: expected p95/p99 or “no-change”

Security: authN/Z impact, secrets added/removed, PII class changes

Tests: oracles touched/added; impact selection hints

Telemetry: events/metrics/log schemas added/changed

Risk: low/medium/high + one-liner rationale

Rollback: “safe/unsafe + how” (and compensations if relevant)

Compat: semver intent (major/minor/patch), wire-compat statement

Provenance: author role (e.g., psm@repo vs human), source branch

Tenancy: isolated|shared (legal data-sharing signal)

ADR: link or ID if an architecture decision is included/updated

Issue-Links: optional GitHub/Jira/etc. references (if you still use them)

Example (illustrative)
feat(generator): add v2 merge path guarded by persona_context_v2

Adds brand policy v2 merge with fallback; preserves v1 behavior by default.

Change-Intent: CI-2025-00123
Scope: src/generation
Graph-IDs: lexi:Function/buildPersonaContext, lexi:Module/BrandRules
Capabilities: CAP-GEN-001
Contract-Delta: {"lexi:Function/buildPersonaContext":{"post":["result.rules.version == brandRules.version"],"effects":{"writes":["event:context_built"]}}}
Effects: +reads: kv:brand_rules:{brandId} ; +writes: event:context_built
Flags: +persona_context_v2 (default=off)
Perf: p95<=50ms (no-change)
Security: authz=role:generator ; PII=none ; secrets=unchanged
Tests: +tests/generation/pipeline.spec.ts::respects_v2_flag ; rerun: returnsExpectedShape
Telemetry: +event=context_built{tenantId,personaId,rulesVersion}
Risk: low – idempotent; no schema drift; guarded by flag
Rollback: safe – flip flag off; no data migration
Compat: minor ; wireCompatible
Provenance: author=ldiffey human ; branch=feature/v2-merge
Tenancy: isolated
ADR: adr/0034-brand-rules-v2.md
Issue-Links: GH#1421

How this plays with SemDoc + the PSM/GA setup
Ingestion into vector + graph

Vector: Store the human subject and a compact serialization of the machine footer as metadata. Chunk long descriptions; keep the footer intact for exact filtering (e.g., Risk: high, Tenancy: shared).

Graph:

Node: (:Commit {sha, timestamp, author, risk, tenancy})

Edges:

(:Commit)-[:TOUCHED]->(:Function|:Module|:Endpoint) via Graph-IDs

(:Commit)-[:CHANGED_CONTRACT]->(:Contract {graph_id})

(:Commit)-[:EMITS]->(:Event)

(:Commit)-[:AFFECTS]->(:Dataset|:Table|:Topic)

(:Commit)-[:IMPLEMENTS]->(:ChangeIntent)

(:Commit)-[:REFERS_TO]->(:ADR)

This makes “find similar changes” and “show all commits that modified CAP-GEN-001 without updating tests” trivial Cypher queries.

Code review & CI gates (without writing code here)

Lint the presence of mandatory trailers (e.g., Scope, Graph-IDs, Risk).

Cross-check Graph-IDs against files changed (SemBlock graph_ids found in diffs).

Contract-Delta sanity: if code signature or declared effects changed, Contract-Delta must mention it (or CI fails).

Effects vs. diff: if code started writing event:X, footer must contain +writes: event:X.

Tenancy: if Tenancy: isolated, block ingestion into any portfolio model pipeline.

Authoring UX (so devs actually use it)

Short vs. extended form:

Short: minimal set (Change-Intent, Graph-IDs, Risk, Tests, Effects).

Extended: everything above. Extended is required on stage: stable contract changes.

Templates:

Provide commit message templates per change type (feature/bugfix/refactor/techdebt).

Git trailers are ergonomic; devs don’t need to write JSON by hand except Contract-Delta when necessary.

PR description as canonical:

In teams that squash-merge, make the PR description the canonical semantic payload. The squash commit message can keep a digest plus a pointer (SemCommit-Source: PR#123). The CI bot copies the structured block into the final commit or stores it as a PR artifact for indexing.

Compatibility with Conventional Commits & friends

Keep subject lines compatible (feat:, fix:, refactor:).

Put SemCommit trailers after any existing footers (BREAKING CHANGE:, etc.).

Parsers can treat SemCommit keys as a dedicated namespace; nothing else breaks.

Monorepos & multi-repo realities

Scope: supports multi-path or package name (e.g., packages/api, packages/ui).

Tenancy: can be per commit (default from repo-level policy) or per package (advanced).

Cross-repo changes: each repo carries its own SemCommit; link them via a Change-Intent ID and graph edges (:RELATES_TO).

Legal & compliance

Tenancy and Provenance footers are your audit lifeline:

Show which commits are safe to feed into a shared (portfolio) model.

Prove which diffs were PSM-generated vs. human.

Prove no commit with PII!=none ever entered the portfolio pipeline.

If a product is sold: export its commits + SemCommit footers + PSM adapters + Experience DB; the portfolio pipeline excludes its history by Tenancy: isolated.

Retrieval patterns that become easy

“Show me all high-risk commits touching lexi:Endpoint/POST_v1_persona_context.”

“Find past diffs where we added a feature flag and later removed it successfully.”

“Which commits changed invariants but forgot tests? (risk spikes).”

“What’s the median p95 delta of commits in src/generation over 90 days?”

“Give me three similar commits to this change so the PSM can imitate the house style.”

Analytics you’ll actually use

Contract drift rate by module (how often code changes force contract changes).

Rollback frequency vs. Risk: label (calibrate your risk taxonomy).

Tenancy leakage attempts caught by CI.

PSM vs. human productivity deltas: first-pass test pass-rate, review iterations, time-to-green.

Migration strategy (existing histories)

Backfill best-effort SemCommits:

Heuristics from diffs (detect added events, tables, endpoints).

Map to SemBlocks by symbol names in hunks.

Infer Risk from churn, touched files (security/infra), and failing tests at that time.

Mark backfilled items with Provenance: backfill so you can treat them as lower-confidence.

Failure modes & guardrails (good/bad/ugly)

Good: History becomes a living playbook; assistants retrieve proven patterns with attached tests and invariants.

Bad: Overly verbose footers that nobody maintains → fix by short form + CI autofill for common fields (effects/tests).

Ugly: Footers lie. Mitigate by CI cross-checks (diff ↔ footer), and signed commits or bot-verified trailers (only CI can write certain keys like Perf/Security after running checks).
