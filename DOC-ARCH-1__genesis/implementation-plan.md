# Centerfire Intelligence - Implementation Plan

## Goal: Bootstrap the System to Build Products Autonomously

### Phase 1: Minimal Bootstrap (Iteration 1-3)
**Objective:** Get basic naming and structure working

#### Iteration 1: Core Naming Service
```bash
# Simple Python implementation (reuse existing daemon infrastructure)
/services/naming-service/
  naming.py         # Basic CAP-DOMAIN-### allocator
  registry.yaml     # Domain definitions
  sequences.json    # Persistent sequence tracking
```

- [ ] Implement basic domain detection (UI, AUTH, DATA, LLM, NET)
- [ ] Sequential number allocation with file-based persistence
- [ ] CID generation using Python's `ulid` library
- [ ] Simple REST API on port 8001

#### Iteration 2: Directory Creator
```bash
/services/structure-service/
  structure.py      # Creates capability directories
  templates/        # Initial file templates
```

- [ ] Creates `/capabilities/CAP-DOMAIN-###__ULID8/` structure
- [ ] Generates initial `.id` file with CID
- [ ] Creates basic `semdoc.yaml` template
- [ ] Integrates with naming service

#### Iteration 3: Simple Code Generation Stub
```bash
/services/code-service/
  generator.py      # Calls Claude API with context
  patterns/         # Code pattern library
```

- [ ] Accepts capability slug + requirements
- [ ] Loads relevant patterns from existing code
- [ ] Calls Claude API with structured prompt
- [ ] Writes generated code to capability directory

### Phase 2: First Product Build (Iteration 4-8)
**Objective:** Use the system to build first revenue-generating product

#### Expected Capability Generation
The system should autonomously create capabilities based on product requirements:
- Authentication capabilities (CAP-AUTH-###)
- Data management capabilities (CAP-DATA-###)
- UI/UX capabilities (CAP-UI-###)
- API/Network capabilities (CAP-NET-###)
- Domain-specific capabilities as needed

#### System Usage Pattern
1. **Define product requirements** in semantic format
2. **Let naming service** allocate appropriate capabilities
3. **Let code service** generate initial implementations
4. **Human reviews** only high-risk changes
5. **System learns** from each accepted change

### Phase 3: System Enhancement (Iteration 9-15)
**Objective:** Make the system self-improving

#### Add Graph Database
- [ ] Neo4j for capability relationships
- [ ] Auto-populate from directory structure
- [ ] Track dependencies between capabilities

#### Add Vector Database
- [ ] Qdrant for semantic search
- [ ] Embed code patterns and documentation
- [ ] Enable similarity-based code generation

#### Create Basic Agent
```python
# AGT-NAMING-001 (proper implementation)
class NamingAgent:
    def allocate_capability(self, domain, purpose):
        # Check semantic similarity
        # Allocate sequence number
        # Update all systems atomically
        # Return in <10ms
```

### Revenue Generation Strategy

#### Iterations 4-8: Launch First Product
- Product built using Centerfire system
- Validate that system can create real value
- Early access pricing model
- Target: Initial paying customers

#### Iterations 9-12: System Improvements from Usage
- Learn from first product build
- Identify patterns and bottlenecks
- Enhance agents based on real usage
- Begin second product in parallel

#### Iterations 13+: Scale Through Automation
- Each product built improves the system
- Agents become more sophisticated
- Build multiple products simultaneously
- Compound learning across all products

### Critical Path Items

1. **Naming Service** (Iteration 1)
   - Without this, nothing else works
   - Must be simple but correct

2. **Basic Code Generation** (Iterations 2-3)
   - System must create real code
   - Start with simple patterns

3. **First Real Capability** (Iteration 4)
   - Prove system can build production code
   - Learn from the experience

4. **Iterative Improvement** (Iteration 5+)
   - Each capability built teaches the system
   - Patterns emerge from usage

### Shortcuts for Speed

1. **Use existing tools**:
   - Supabase for auth/database
   - Vercel for hosting
   - Stripe for payments
   - Claude API for generation

2. **Skip perfection**:
   - File-based sequence storage initially
   - No complex agents at first
   - Manual deployment initially

3. **Focus on value**:
   - LexicRoot must solve real problem
   - Centerfire improvements come from revenue

### Success Metrics

Iterations 1-3:
- [ ] Can create named capabilities automatically
- [ ] Basic code generation working
- [ ] Directory structure follows convention

Iterations 4-8:
- [ ] First product MVP built using system
- [ ] System successfully manages capabilities
- [ ] Code generation reduces manual work by 50%+

Iterations 9-15:
- [ ] System creating 80% of new code
- [ ] Multiple capabilities working together
- [ ] Clear patterns emerging for reuse

### Next Immediate Action

```bash
# Right now, today:
cd /Users/larrydiffey/projects/CenterfireIntelligence
mkdir -p services/naming-service
cd services/naming-service

# Create the simplest possible naming allocator
# Just needs to work, not be perfect
```

The key is: **Start simple, generate revenue quickly, use revenue to build the dream.**
