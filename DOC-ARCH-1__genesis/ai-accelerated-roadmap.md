- [ ] Contracts validating automatically
- [ ] Change Intents replacing TODOs
- [ ] Semantic commits standard

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks:
- **C++ complexity**: Use modern C++20, RAII, smart pointers
- **Integration issues**: Keep Python daemon as fallback
- **Performance regression**: Continuous benchmarking

### Operational Risks:
- **Data loss**: Parallel operation before cutover
- **Downtime**: Blue-green deployment strategy
- **Rollback needed**: Git tags at each milestone

---

## Resource Requirements

### AI Assistant Time:
- **Claude Code (Sonnet)**: 200+ hours of development
- **Claude (Opus)**: 10 hours of architecture/design
- **Local LLM**: Continuous for simple tasks

### Infrastructure:
- **Build servers**: For C++ compilation
- **Test environment**: Mirror of production
- **Monitoring**: Prometheus/Grafana stack

---

## Immediate Next Steps (Today)

1. **Switch to Sonnet 4.0** for implementation
2. **Start adding SemBlocks** to existing Python code
3. **Set up C++ project** with CMake and modern toolchain
4. **Begin Redis client** implementation in C++
5. **Create first Change Intent** for C++ migration

*This aggressive timeline is achievable with AI-driven development. Human involvement is primarily for decisions and reviews, not implementation. The key is parallel execution and continuous operation - Claude Code doesn't need breaks.*

**Total estimated AI development hours: 400-500 hours over 30 days**
**Human oversight required: 2-3 hours per day for reviews and decisions**

**Result: Full semantic architecture with blazing fast C++ daemon in one month.**
