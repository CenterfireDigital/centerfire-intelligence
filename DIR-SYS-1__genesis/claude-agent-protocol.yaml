# CORE PRINCIPLE: Everything goes through agents
never_create_directly:
  - directories (ask AGT-STRUCT-1)
  - names (ask AGT-NAMING-1) 
  - documentation (ask AGT-SEMDOC-1)
  - code (ask AGT-CODING-1)
  - semantic analysis (ask AGT-SEMANTIC-1)
  - graph relationships (ask AGT-GRAPH-1 - when created)

# AGENT DELEGATION CHAIN
workflow:
  human_request: |
    1. Human: "Create authentication capability"
    2. Claude asks AGT-NAMING-1: allocate_capability("AUTH", "user authentication")
    3. AGT-NAMING-1 returns: CAP-AUTH-2__01K4EAF3
    4. AGT-NAMING-1 delegates to AGT-STRUCT-1: create_structure
    5. AGT-STRUCT-1 creates directories and files
    6. AGT-STRUCT-1 delegates to AGT-SEMDOC-1: create_documentation
    7. All agents report completion back to Claude
    8. Claude reports to human: "CAP-AUTH-2 ready"

# CRITICAL REMINDERS FOR CLAUDE
claude_instructions: |
  ALWAYS read this file first in new sessions.
  
  AGENT DELEGATION (NEVER create directly):
  - Directories → AGT-STRUCT-1 (working)
  - Names → AGT-NAMING-1 (working, needs PROJECT.ENV.TYPE update)
  - Semantic analysis → AGT-SEMANTIC-1 (working with namespaces)
  - Code → AGT-CODING-1 (created)
  - Documentation → AGT-SEMDOC-1 (created) 
  - Graph relationships → AGT-GRAPH-1 (not created)
  
  SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE:
  - Agent-oriented (not service-oriented) - everything flows through agents
  - Semantic namespacing: PROJECT.ENV.TYPE (centerfire.dev/test/prod)
  - Stream philosophy: agents MONITOR infrastructure, don't BECOME it
  - Working channels: agent.naming.request, agent.struct.request, agent.semantic.request
  
  AUTO-READ HOOK INSTALLED: Future sessions will see reminder to read this file

# SESSION RECOVERY  
steps: "Read directives → Check agent status → Start agents → Test communication"
