# SemDoc Chicken/Egg Problems Analysis

## Overview
This document identifies fundamental chicken/egg problems blocking SemDoc implementation and proposes bootstrapping solutions.

## Primary Chicken/Egg Problems

### 1. **Contract Definition Problem**
**The Problem**: To write behavioral contracts, you need to understand the domain. But to understand the domain semantically, you need contracts to define the behavior.

**Current State**: We have a naming convention (AGT-NAMING-1) but no actual behavioral contracts.

**Manifestations**:
- Can't write auth contracts without knowing what "authentication" means behaviorally
- Can't define payment contracts without behavioral specifications for "payment processing"
- Can't create semantic paths without understanding domain relationships

**Nested Problems**:
- **Domain Expert Problem**: Who defines what "auth.session.jwt" actually means behaviorally?
- **Specification Language Problem**: What format should contracts use before SemDoc exists?
- **Validation Problem**: How do you validate contracts before contract validators exist?

### 2. **Parser Bootstrap Problem**
**The Problem**: Need @semblock parsers to extract contracts from code, but need contracts to build the parsers.

**Current State**: AGT-SEMDOC-PARSER doesn't exist because we don't have contracts for it to parse.

**Circular Dependencies**:
- Need parser to extract contracts → Need contracts to define parser behavior
- Need contracts in code → Need parser to find contracts in code
- Need contract validation → Need contracts to define validation logic

**Nested Problems**:
- **Language Detection**: How does parser know which comment format contains contracts?
- **Syntax Validation**: How does it validate YAML/JSON in comments without contract specs?
- **Error Handling**: How does it report parsing errors without error handling contracts?

### 3. **Agent Authorization Bootstrap**
**The Problem**: Casbin can do RBAC but can't enforce behavioral contracts. SemDoc can enforce contracts but needs agents to exist first.

**Current Gap**:
- Casbin: "AGT-AUTH-1 can access auth.* resources" ✓
- Missing: "AGT-AUTH-1 must validate JWT signatures and check expiration" ✗

**Circular Dependencies**:
- Need agents to write contracts → Need contracts to authorize agents
- Need authorization to spawn agents → Need agents to validate authorization
- Need behavioral validation → Need behaviors to validate

**Nested Problems**:
- **Permission vs. Behavior Gap**: RBAC ≠ behavioral contracts
- **Runtime Enforcement**: Who enforces behavioral contracts during execution?
- **Contract Evolution**: How do authorization policies evolve with contracts?

### 4. **Semantic Identity Bootstrap**
**The Problem**: Need semantic understanding to assign ULIDs meaningfully, but need ULIDs to build semantic understanding.

**Current State**: AGT-NAMING-1 generates ULIDs but doesn't understand semantic relationships.

**Bootstrap Issues**:
- `capability.auth.session.jwt` - What makes this semantically different from `capability.auth.session.oauth`?
- Inheritance paths - How do you know `auth.jwt` inherits from `auth` without understanding "auth"?
- Domain boundaries - Where does "auth" end and "user" begin semantically?

**Nested Problems**:
- **Semantic Hierarchy Problem**: Who defines the taxonomy structure?
- **Naming Consistency Problem**: How do you ensure consistent semantic paths across domains?
- **Identity Collision Problem**: How do you prevent semantic conflicts?

### 5. **Storage Layer Chicken/Egg**
**The Problem**: Need contracts stored in Redis/Weaviate/Neo4j, but need contracts to define how to store contracts.

**Current State**: Storage schemas exist but no contracts define their usage patterns.

**Circular Dependencies**:
- Need storage schemas → Need contracts defining storage behavior
- Need cross-system consistency → Need contracts defining consistency requirements  
- Need data validation → Need contracts defining validation rules

**Nested Problems**:
- **Schema Evolution**: How do storage schemas evolve with contract changes?
- **Cross-System Integrity**: How do you maintain consistency without consistency contracts?
- **Performance Contracts**: How do you define storage performance without performance contracts?

### 6. **Validation Bootstrap Problem**
**The Problem**: Need contract validators, but validators themselves need contracts to define their behavior.

**The Meta-Problem**: How do you validate the contracts that define how contract validation works?

**Infinite Regress Issues**:
- Who validates the validator's contracts?
- How do you bootstrap trust in the validation system?
- What validates the validation rules?

**Nested Problems**:
- **Self-Reference Problem**: Can a system define its own validation rules?
- **Circular Validation**: Validator A validates Validator B, Validator B validates Validator A
- **Base Case Problem**: What's the foundational truth that doesn't need validation?

## Secondary Chicken/Egg Problems

### 7. **Error Handling Bootstrap**
**The Problem**: Need error handling contracts to handle contract violations, but contract violations might occur in error handling.

### 8. **Testing Framework Bootstrap**
**The Problem**: Need tests to validate contracts, but tests need contracts to define testing behavior.

### 9. **Documentation Generation Bootstrap**
**The Problem**: Need to generate human-readable docs from contracts, but generation logic needs contracts.

### 10. **Agent Communication Bootstrap**
**The Problem**: Agents need to communicate via contracts, but communication protocols need contracts.

## The Fundamental Meta-Problem

**The Core Issue**: SemDoc is a self-describing system that needs itself to exist before it can be built.

**Manifestations**:
- Every component needs contracts to function
- Contracts need the system to exist before they can be written  
- The system needs contracts to be built
- **Infinite dependency loop**

## Current "Solutions" That Don't Solve The Problem

### 1. **AGT-NAMING-1 (Current)**
- **What it does**: Generates ULIDs and semantic paths
- **What it doesn't do**: Understand what those paths mean behaviorally
- **Gap**: Naming without semantics ≠ semantic system

### 2. **Casbin Bootstrap (Planned)**
- **What it does**: RBAC authorization for agents
- **What it doesn't do**: Behavioral contract enforcement
- **Gap**: Permission to access ≠ permission to behave incorrectly

### 3. **Documentation Approach (Current)**
- **What it does**: Specifies how SemDoc should work
- **What it doesn't do**: Provides bootstrapping mechanism
- **Gap**: Specification ≠ implementation pathway

## The Bootstrap Challenge

**Question**: How do you create the first behavioral contract in a system that requires behavioral contracts to function?

**Sub-Questions**:
1. What's the minimal viable contract that can bootstrap the system?
2. How do you validate the bootstrap contract without a validator?
3. How do you evolve from bootstrap contracts to full SemDoc?
4. What external dependencies are acceptable for bootstrapping?

## Potential Bootstrap Strategies (To Be Analyzed)

### Strategy 1: **Manual Bootstrap Contracts**
Write the first contracts by hand, validate manually, use to build the system.

### Strategy 2: **External System Bootstrap**  
Use external tools (like OpenAPI, JSON Schema) to define initial contracts.

### Strategy 3: **Minimal Viable SemDoc**
Build the smallest possible SemDoc that can build a bigger SemDoc.

### Strategy 4: **Domain-First Bootstrap**
Pick one domain (like "auth"), manually define all its contracts, use as foundation.

### Strategy 5: **Meta-Contract Bootstrap**
Define contracts that describe how to write contracts, bootstrap from there.

## Next Steps Required

1. **Analyze each bootstrap strategy** for viability
2. **Design minimal viable contracts** for chosen strategy
3. **Define bootstrap sequence** - what gets built in what order
4. **Identify external dependencies** acceptable for bootstrapping
5. **Create bootstrap validation method** - how do you know it works?

*This analysis reveals why SemDoc implementation has stalled - we're trying to build a self-describing system without solving the fundamental bootstrap problem. No code should be written until we have a clear bootstrap strategy.*
